Lock up to 2**100 uETH, 100% backed 1:1 by ETH.
Helps solve liquidity problems on Uniswap without any protocol upgrades.

dApp:
https://ulock.eth

How it works:
When liquidity is locked on a capped token, no more than the cap minus locked reserves can be sold.
With this difference, a calculatable amount of uEth in Uniswap is permanently locked and can never be redeemed for Eth.
If the contract knows ahead of time that the uEth will be permanently locked, it can issue unbacked uEth.
Other uEth can only be minted through depositing Eth.
Thus all circulating uEth is 1:1 backed by Eth.

Feel free to farm the Eth/uEth pair or run arbitration bots between the uEth wrapper and the Uniswap pair.
